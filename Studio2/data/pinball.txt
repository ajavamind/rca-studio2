Pinball simulates the action of real pinball machines.
The object of the game is to keep your ball in play and
score as many points as you can by ball contact with
point bumpers.  The point value of bumpers changes 
randomly when hit.  Points range from 2 to 9.
A score greater than 999 stops the game.

Pinball can be played by one or two persons.  
Players take turns scoring points and control flippers
on their own keyboard throughout the game.  A player can
change the ball direction by shoving the cabinet with key 0.
However, overuse of this feature will result in a "TILT".

1. Select the one-player game with key 1.
   Select the two-player game with key 2.
2. In the two-player game, players alternate turns.  
   PLayers get five balls.  The number of balls remaining 
   is shown at the right or left of the players score.  
   Your turn to put a ball in play is shown by a flashing
   digit (balls remaining) on your side of the TV screen.
3. To put ball in play, press key 1.
4. Press key 4 to control the left flipper and 
   key 6 to control the right flipper.
5. You can press key 0 to reverse the direction of the ball.
   This feature is handy for saving a ball 
   (outside the flipper range) that will go out of
   bounds.  
   This feature simulates physically pushing on a 
   PINBALL game cabinet. 
   Pressing key 0 causes the ball to move at high speed.
   While the ball travesl high speed, key 0 has no effect.
6. If you overuse key 0, you will cause a "TILT" and 
   the game will stop.
   If the two-player option was selected and 
   the other player has balls left,
   press key 1 to put a new ball in play.
7. The game is over when either player scores more than
   999 points, when both players have "TILT", 
   or when both use all their balls.
